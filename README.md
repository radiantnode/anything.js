# anything.js or Î”.js
A javascript library that contains anything you want.

    bower install anything.js

# What is this?
A javascript library that I will accept any pull request on (as long as it follows the rules).

# Why?
I think it will be interesting to see what people want to add to this. Obviously being the internet I don't expect anything good to come of it.

# Rules
1. Nothing that'll crash a web page.
1. Can't violate GitHub terms of service.
1. Don't be an asshole.
  1. Nothing malicious.  
  1. Deleting stuff that doesn't need to be.
